  2. set up a Postgresql relational database
       a. create a database user
       b. create an credentials file for this user.
       c. create an "epics scan" database for this user.
  3. configure which detectors and positioners to use.
  4. start collecting data, using either Python scripts,
     or the supplied graphical user interface.


1. Install this package
------------------------

Install the Python Package with

    pip install epicsscan

You may need help from someone with system adminstrator rights.
This sounds harder than it is.

First, you'll need to have a postgresql server running on your network.
